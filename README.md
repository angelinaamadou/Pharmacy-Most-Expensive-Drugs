# Pharmacy-Most-Expensive-Drugs
Description
===========
The project is an open source collaborative coding challenge. The goal of the project is to organize a pharmaceutical dataset according to the total costs of medicine.  Additionally, the frequency of the drug prescription is retrieved.

Details
=======
An inventory dataset of an online pharmacy is provided.
The dataset is composed of five attributes namely an id, a prescriber last and first name, the drug name, and the drug cost. 
The dataset is read and parsed one line at a time.The resulting number of attributes is examined for consistency.
Each parsed line is stored in a dictionary with the drug name as key and the drug cost as a value.  Furthermore, the data is aggregated by the drug name by calculating the total cost of the drug and the number of time it was prescribed.


Software
=======
Python 3
